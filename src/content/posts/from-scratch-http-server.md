# A word on why

This post is (hopefully) the first in a series of explorations in building stuff from scratch as an educational pursuit. Frameworks and libraries hide details in the name of productivity and the future of LLM-powered development looks to obsolesce "handwritten code" entirely. Never before has it been easier to build without knowing anything about the layers of abstraction beneath you. And that's mostly good! But I find satisfaction in digging deeper and filling out my understanding of the stuff I build on every day.

Maybe peeking into the machine is wasted effort in an era when I can just tell the machine to make me an app, but I want to learn more about how things work for learning's own sake. So I'm going to!
